# AttentionSpan üéØ

> **The World's Most Passive-Aggressive Productivity Tool**

## What the Heck is This? ü§î

Welcome to AttentionSpan, the revolutionary eye-tracking app that monitors your attention with the precision of a disappointed parent and the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Because nothing motivates like shame, animated GIFs, and the crushing weight of your own inadequacy.

## The Problem We're "Solving" üò§

You know that feeling when you're supposed to be working but instead you're:
- Watching cat videos on YouTube
- Reading Wikipedia articles about the history of cheese
- Staring at your screen pretending to work while actually daydreaming about lunch
- Checking your phone for the 47th time this hour

**AttentionSpan doesn't solve this problem.** Instead, it makes you feel *really bad* about it by showing you disappointment GIFs every time you look away. It's like having a judgmental roommate who never pays rent but always judges your life choices.

## How It Works (Or Doesn't) üî¨

1. **Advanced Iris Tracking**: Uses TensorFlow.js Face Landmarks Detection with MediaPipe Iris model to track your eyeballs with military precision - now with 468 facial landmarks including iris keypoints
2. **Disappointment Delivery**: The moment you look away, you get hit with a curated collection of disappointment GIFs
3. **Shame Spiral**: Watch your self-esteem decrease proportionally to your productivity increase
4. **Leaderboard of Shame**: Compete with other masochists to see who can stare at their screen the longest

## Features That Nobody Asked For ‚ú®

- üé≠ **State-of-the-art disappointment technology** (patent pending)
- üëÅÔ∏è **Military-grade eye tracking** (because regular eye tracking wasn't judgmental enough)
- üòû **Curated disappointment GIFs** (hand-picked to maximize guilt)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Precision timing** (down to the millisecond of your failure)
- üèÜ **Leaderboard of champions** (who apparently have no social lives)
- üì± **Mobile-friendly shame** (now you can feel bad anywhere!)

## Prerequisites & Setup üîß

### Required:
- **Web server with PHP support** (Apache, Nginx, or local development server)
- **Giphy API key** (free from https://developers.giphy.com/)
- **HTTPS or localhost** (required for camera access)

### API Configuration:

1. **Get Giphy API Key:**
   - Visit https://developers.giphy.com/
   - Create account and get free API key
   - Replace `$GIPHY_API_KEY` in `giphy.php` (line 78)

2. **Configure CORS Domains:**
   - Edit `giphy.php` line 4: `$allowedDomains = ['yourdomain.com'];`
   - Add your actual domain(s) to the array
   - For localhost: `$allowedDomains = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1'];`

3. **File Permissions:**
   ```bash
   chmod 666 leaderboard_data.txt
   chmod 666 rate_limit.txt
   ```

## Installation (Why Are You Still Reading This?) üöÄ

```bash
# Clone this repository (if you really want to)
git clone https://github.com/davidemorotti/attentionspan.git

# Navigate to the folder of regret
cd attentionspan

# Configure your Giphy API key and CORS domains (see Prerequisites above)

# Start a local PHP server
php -S localhost:8000

# Open http://localhost:8000/app.html in your browser
# Prepare for disappointment
```

## Usage Instructions üìñ

1. **Open `app.html`** in your browser (the main app)
2. **Allow camera access** (yes, we're watching you)
3. **Wait for the 3-second countdown** (time to prepare for disappointment)
4. **Try to focus** (good luck with that)
5. **Get disappointed** (this is the main feature)
6. **Click "Try Again"** to restart your misery
7. **Register your score** to join the leaderboard of shame
8. **Repeat until you question your life choices**

## Technical Details (For the Nerds) üîß

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (because we're not pretentious)
- **Eye Tracking**: MediaPipe Face Mesh with Iris landmarks (468 facial landmarks for maximum judgment)
- **Backend**: PHP (because we hate ourselves)
- **Database**: Text files (we're not fancy enough for SQL)
- **API**: Giphy API for disappointment GIFs
- **Security**: CORS protection, rate limiting, input validation
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Security Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **API Key**: Never commit your Giphy API key to public repositories
- **CORS**: Configure allowed domains to prevent unauthorized access
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against spam (10 requests/hour per IP)
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions for data files

## Known Issues (There Are Many) üêõ

- **Doesn't actually improve productivity** (this is a feature, not a bug)
- **May cause existential crisis** (also a feature)
- **Eye tracking accuracy varies** (depends on how much coffee you've had)
- **Works best with good lighting** (and low self-esteem)
- **May trigger imposter syndrome** (especially if you're already prone to it)
- **Camera access required** (privacy concerns are valid)
- **Giphy API rate limits** (free tier has daily limits)

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues:

**"Camera not working"**
- Ensure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Check browser permissions for camera access
- Try refreshing the page

**"GIFs not loading"**
- Check your Giphy API key in `giphy.php`
- Verify CORS domain configuration
- Check browser console for errors

**"Leaderboard not working"**
- Ensure PHP server is running
- Check file permissions for `leaderboard_data.txt`
- Verify CORS headers in `leaderboard.php`

**"Eye tracking not accurate"**
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Keep face centered in camera view
- Avoid wearing glasses (if possible)
- Try different browsers

**"CORS errors"**
- Update `$allowedDomains` in `giphy.php`
- Add your domain to the allowed list
- For localhost: `['localhost', '127.0.0.1']`

### Development Setup:

```bash
# For local development
php -S localhost:8000

# For production (example with Apache)
# Ensure mod_rewrite is enabled
# Configure virtual host with PHP support
```
